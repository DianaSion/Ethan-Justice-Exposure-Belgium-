## 🎯 Key Claims (The Core Issues)

### 1. ⚖️ Procedural Timing Defect (MOST CRITICAL)
**What happened:**
- **Sep 2, 2022:** Prosecutor orders police to investigate school for neglect
- **Sep 29, 2022:** Juvenile court issues out-of-home placement order
- **Oct 14, 2022:** Police complete school investigation

**Problem:** Court ruled 15 days BEFORE the investigation concluded, acting on incomplete facts.

**Evidence:** 
- `/evidence/03_police_prosecution/2022-09-02_prosecutor_order_investigate_school.pdf`
- `/evidence/04_juvenile_court_SDJ/2022-09-29_ruling.pdf`
- `/evidence/03_police_prosecution/2022-10-14_police_return.pdf`

**Why it matters:** This is a due process violation—decisions should be based on complete information.

---

### 2. 🏥 Expert Consensus Ignored
**What happened:**
Every independent medical/psychological expert opposed out-of-home placement:
- **OOOC Ter Heide:** "Placement would be harmful, oppose extension"
- **MPK/Vleugel K:** Diagnosed cPTSD linked to institutional processes
- **Emergency Room:** Documented acute distress related to placement threat

**Problem:** Expert assessments were disregarded; institutional plans proceeded anyway.

**Evidence:**
- `/evidence/05_medical_psych/2023-09-17_OOOC_final.pdf`
- `/evidence/05_medical_psych/MPK_VleugelK_diagnosis.pdf`
- `/evidence/05_medical_psych/2022-11-11_ER_redacted.pdf`

**Why it matters:** When do expert opinions matter if institutions can ignore them?

---

### 3. 📋 Hidden Long-term Plans
**What happened:**
- **Stated purpose:** "Short-term diagnostics"
- **Actual plan (revealed in A-DOC):** Long-term institutionalization (to age 18-21) with subsidy requests

**Problem:** Purpose drift—families told one thing, institutions plan another.

**Evidence:**
- `/evidence/04_juvenile_court_SDJ/2023-04-26_SDJ_A-DOC.pdf`

**Why it matters:** Transparency and informed consent are fundamental rights.

---

### 4. 🚫 Manufactured "Non-cooperation"
**What happened:**
- Parent requested 1-on-1 meeting with CLB due to safety concerns
- CLB refused the reasonable accommodation
- CLB then filed M-doc claiming "non-cooperation"

**Problem:** Refusal of reasonable request weaponized as grounds for escalation.

**Evidence:**
- `/evidence/02_CLB/2021-11-25_parent_1on1_request.eml`
- `/evidence/02_CLB/2021-11-30_M-doc.pdf`

**Why it matters:** Shows how institutional narratives can be manufactured.

---

### 5. 🎓 School Negligence & Cover-up
**What happened:**
- Bullying and stabbing incident at school (Oct 28, 2021)
- School minimized handling
- Trauma-related absences weaponized against parent

**Problem:** Original institutional failure (school) led to cascading interventions against family.

**Evidence:**
- `/evidence/01_school/2021-10-28_incident_report.pdf`
- School correspondence

**Why it matters:** Institutional accountability starts with acknowledging initial failures.

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Is this just one family complaining?
**A:** No. This is evidence-based documentation of procedural defects, expert consensus being ignored, and hidden institutional plans. The claims are backed by official documents, expert reports, and medical records.

### Q: Why make this public?
**A:** Public awareness serves as accountability. When society knows, evidence cannot be suppressed and institutions must respond. This case may also help prevent similar situations for other families.

### Q: What about privacy?
**A:** All materials are properly redacted per GDPR and Belgian privacy law. See `PRIVACY.md` for full policies.

### Q: Was the child actually removed from home?
**A:** No. Despite orders, Ethan was never actually placed out of home. Appeals and expert assessments prevented it. However, the threat itself caused documented psychological harm.

### Q: What's the procedural timing defect?
**A:** The juvenile court issued a placement order on Sep 29, 2022, but the police didn't complete their investigation into school neglect until Oct 14, 2022—15 days later. The court acted on incomplete information.

### Q: What do you want to happen?
**A:** 
1. Recognition of procedural defects
2. Acknowledgment that expert assessments should matter
3. Transparency about institutional planning
4. Systemic reforms to prevent recurrence
5. Accountability for documented failures

### Q: How can I verify this information?
**A:** All exhibits are referenced with file paths. Review the original documents in `/evidence/`. Cross-check against the timeline and contradictions analysis. Everything is evidence-based.
