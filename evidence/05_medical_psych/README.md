# Medical & Psychological Evidence

This directory contains medical records, psychological assessments, and expert diagnostic reports.

## Key Evidence Types

### Emergency Medical Records
- ER visit (11-11-2022) documenting acute anxiety/separation distress
- Other medical interventions
- Hospital assessments

### Psychological Assessments
- MPK/Vleugel K cPTSD diagnosis
- Treatment records
- Therapeutic assessments
- Progress notes

### Expert Diagnostic Reports
- OOOC Ter Heide final report (17-09-2023)
- Interim diagnostic findings
- Expert recommendations
- Opposition to placement

### Causation Documentation
- Evidence linking symptoms to specific events
- Timeline of psychological changes
- Treatment response documentation

## Evidence Standards

All documents in this directory must be:
- ✅ **Heavily redacted** per PRIVACY.md - medical records are especially sensitive
- ✅ **Dated** clearly in filename
- ✅ **Indexed** in /evidence/INDEX.md
- ✅ **Causation mapped** in /analysis/harm_model.md

## Key Claims Supported

### Claim #7: Medical Evidence Disregarded
Multiple independent medical and psychological assessments document:

1. **cPTSD Diagnosis** (MPK/Vleugel K)
   - Complex post-traumatic stress disorder
   - Causally linked to school incident AND institutional processes
   - Requires trauma-informed care, not removal from primary caregiver

2. **Acute Distress** (ER 11-11-2022)
   - Emergency presentation with anxiety
   - Separation distress
   - Temporal correlation with placement threat

3. **Expert Opposition** (OOOC Ter Heide 17-09-2023)
   - Out-of-home placement "contraindicated"
   - Would be "harmful" to child
   - Explicit recommendation against extension

### Expert Consensus
All independent medical/psychological experts agree:
- Removal would cause harm
- Institutional processes have contributed to trauma
- Family-based care with appropriate support is indicated
- Court intervention itself is a source of distress

## Privacy Notes

**CRITICAL:** Medical records contain highly sensitive information.

### Must Redact:
- Patient identifying information beyond first name
- Specific medical details not relevant to legal claims
- Names of medical providers
- Medical record numbers
- Addresses of facilities
- Insurance information
- Detailed symptoms beyond what's legally necessary

### May Include:
- Dates of service
- General diagnoses relevant to legal claims (e.g., "cPTSD")
- Expert conclusions regarding causation
- Recommendations opposing specific interventions
- General facility names where relevant (OOOC Ter Heide, MPK/Vleugel K)

### Redaction Verification
Before publishing any medical document:
1. Review against PRIVACY.md standards
2. Strip all metadata
3. Ensure only legally relevant information remains
4. Verify no reverse-identification possible
5. Document redactions in audit trail

## Legal Context

### Proportionality & Necessity
Expert medical consensus that placement would be harmful raises serious questions about:
- **Proportionality:** Is the intervention proportionate to the identified need?
- **Necessity:** Is removal necessary when experts oppose it?
- **Best Interest:** How can placement be in the child's best interest when experts say it's harmful?

### Causation Chain
Medical evidence establishes that institutional processes **caused or exacerbated** psychological harm:

```
School Incident (Primary Trauma)
        ↓
Institutional Response (Secondary Trauma)
        ↓
Court Threat of Removal (Acute Distress)
        ↓
cPTSD Diagnosis (Causally Linked)
```

This causation chain is documented in `/analysis/harm_model.md`.

### Iatrogenic Harm
The term "iatrogenic" refers to harm caused by medical/institutional treatment itself. Here, expert evidence suggests that:
- The threat of placement caused acute distress (ER visit)
- Court processes contributed to cPTSD (expert finding)
- Continued intervention may worsen rather than improve outcomes

This raises institutional liability questions and supports the argument for withdrawal or reduction of intervention.
