## Key Claims Supported

- CLB claim of "non-cooperation" contradicted by documented accommodation request
- Refusal of reasonable 1-on-1 meeting
- Medical justifications for absences were present but disregarded

## Legal Context

CLB's role in escalating to juvenile court through the M-doc is central to understanding how school-level issues became child welfare interventions. The refusal of reasonable accommodation (1-on-1 meeting) undermines the "non-cooperation" narrative.
