## Key Claims Supported

### Claim #1: Procedural Timing Defect (CRITICAL)
- Juvenile ruling (29-09-2022) issued **before** police return on school investigation (14-10-2022)
- This 15-day gap undermines the factual basis of the ruling
- Central to due process challenge

### Claim #5: Hidden Long-term Plan
- SDJ A-DOC (26-04-2023) reveals institutionalization plan (age 18-21)
- Includes subsidy requests and funding strategies
- Contradicts stated "short-term diagnostics" purpose
- Demonstrates pre-planning inconsistent with child-centered care

### Claim #6: Outcome Mischaracterization
- Despite orders, **no actual out-of-home placement occurred**
- Extensions contested and reversed
- Expert assessments opposed removal
- Accurate outcome phrasing essential

### Claim #7: Disregard of Expert Assessment
- OOOC Ter Heide explicitly opposes placement
- Found placement would be "harmful"
- Expert consensus ignored in favor of administrative plans

## Privacy Notes

- Redact Ethan's last name and identifying details
- Redact names of social workers and non-public staff
- Judges' names may be used where relevant to procedural accountability
- Redact case numbers or use partial redaction

## Legal Context

### Procedural Due Process
The timing defect is the **cornerstone** of the procedural challenge:

```
02-09-2022: Prosecutor orders school investigation
29-09-2022: Juvenile court issues placement ruling (PREMATURE)
14-10-2022: Police complete school investigation
```

The court acted on incomplete facts. The subsequent police findings about school neglect were not available to inform the placement decision.

### Purpose Drift
The A-DOC reveals a fundamental shift from stated purpose to actual intent:
- **Stated:** Short-term diagnostics
- **Actual:** Long-term institutionalization with subsidy planning

This purpose drift raises questions about the legitimacy of the initial intervention.

### Expert Opposition
OOOC Ter Heide's independent assessment **explicitly contradicts** the basis for continued intervention. The disregard of this expert opinion must be explained or justified by the court.
