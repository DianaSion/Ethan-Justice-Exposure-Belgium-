## Key Claims Supported

### Claim #1: Procedural Timing Defect
- Prosecutor orders school investigation: 02-09-2022
- Juvenile court issues placement ruling: 29-09-2022
- Police return school investigation: 14-10-2022
- **Issue:** Juvenile ruling predates completion of related criminal investigation

### Claim #4: Evidence Suppression
- Audio evidence seized but discounted without explanation
- Victim status recognized then criminal track sidelined
- Complaint redirected from institutional accountability to family scrutiny

## Privacy Notes

- Redact victim/witness names (except where Diana is the acknowledged victim)
- Redact personal identifiers
- Redact non-public officials' names
- Keep public officials' names where relevant to accountability

## Legal Context

The timing sequence between criminal investigation and juvenile court ruling is **central** to the due process challenge. The juvenile court issued a placement order before the police completed their investigation into the very school incident that precipitated the case.

This creates a procedural defect: the factual basis for the juvenile ruling was incomplete and later undercut by the police findings.
