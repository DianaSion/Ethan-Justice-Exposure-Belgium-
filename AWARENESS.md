## Key Messages

### Core Message
"This repository documents systematic failures in Belgium's legal system that harmed a child despite overwhelming expert evidence. The case reveals procedural defects, suppression of evidence, disregard of medical assessments, and hidden institutionalization plans that violate children's rights."

### Supporting Messages

**1. Procedural Timing Defect**
"A juvenile court issued an out-of-home placement order BEFORE the police completed their investigation into the school's role—undermining the factual basis for the ruling."

**2. Expert Consensus Ignored**
"Every independent medical expert opposed removal and documented harm, yet institutional plans proceeded anyway. When do expert assessments matter?"

**3. Hidden Long-term Plans**
"Documents reveal a hidden plan for long-term institutionalization (to age 18-21) with subsidy requests—contradicting the stated 'short diagnostics' purpose."

**4. Manufactured Non-cooperation**
"A reasonable request for a 1-on-1 safety meeting was refused, then weaponized as 'non-cooperation' to escalate to child welfare intervention."

**5. Outcome Matters**
"Although removal orders were issued, the child was never actually placed out of home—appeals and expert input prevented it. But the process itself caused documented psychological harm."

⚖️ Procedural timing defect in Belgian juvenile case:

• Sep 2: Prosecutor orders school investigation
• Sep 29: Court issues placement ruling
• Oct 14: Police complete investigation

The court acted on incomplete facts. This is the cornerstone of the due process challenge.

**Post 3 - Expert Consensus**
```
🏥 Medical experts in Belgian case unanimously agreed:
• Out-of-home placement would be harmful
• cPTSD linked to institutional processes
• Family-based care indicated

Yet institutional plans proceeded anyway.

When do expert assessments matter?

I'm sharing an important case study in institutional accountability and children's rights.

A GitHub repository documents a Belgian juvenile case with significant procedural defects:

🔍 Key Finding: A juvenile court issued an out-of-home placement order 15 days before the police completed a related criminal investigation into school neglect. This timing creates a due process problem—the court acted on incomplete facts.

📊 Expert Consensus: OOOC Ter Heide, MPK/Vleugel K, and ER medical staff all documented harm and opposed removal. None were heeded.

📄 Hidden Plans: Internal documents revealed long-term institutionalization plans (to age 18-21) contradicting stated "short diagnostics" purposes.

This case raises important questions about:
• Procedural safeguards in juvenile justice
• The weight given to expert medical assessments
• Transparency in institutional decision-making
• Children's rights in practice vs. principle

The repository is organized with evidence, timeline, analysis, and legal filings—all privacy-compliant and evidence-based.

Title: GitHub repository documents systematic failures in Belgian juvenile justice case

A detailed repository documents a Belgian juvenile case with serious procedural issues:

• Juvenile court ruled before police completed related investigation (15-day gap)
• Every independent medical expert opposed removal and documented harm
• Internal documents revealed hidden long-term institutionalization plans
• "Non-cooperation" claim contradicted by documented accommodation requests

The repository includes evidence, timeline, legal analysis, and is organized for transparency and accountability. All privacy-compliant with CC BY 4.0 license.

This isn't about one case—it's about systemic patterns that could affect many families.

What are your thoughts on the procedural timing issue? Should courts rule before related investigations conclude?

Title: [Belgium] Procedural timing defect in juvenile case—court ruled before investigation concluded

Looking for perspectives on a Belgian juvenile case with a significant timing issue:

• Sep 2, 2022: Prosecutor orders police to investigate school for neglect
• Sep 29, 2022: Juvenile court issues out-of-home placement order
• Oct 14, 2022: Police complete and return school investigation

The court ruled 15 days before the investigation concluded. The factual findings about school neglect would have been relevant to the placement decision.

Is this a due process violation? Are there Belgian legal provisions that address this?

Any insights from legal professionals familiar with Belgian juvenile law would be appreciated.

### Facebook Groups

I want to share something important about our legal system's handling of children's cases.

A GitHub repository documents a case where:
• A child experienced trauma at school (bullying/stabbing)
• The family requested a 1-on-1 safety meeting with CLB
• CLB refused and escalated to child welfare system
• Despite EVERY medical expert opposing removal, institutional plans proceeded

The most concerning part: The juvenile court issued a placement order BEFORE the police finished investigating the school's role.

This could happen to any family. The repository is detailed, evidence-based, and focused on systemic reform.

Please read and share. When society knows, evidence can't be ignored.
