## Example 1: OOOC Ter Heide Report

### Full Citation Block

The diagnostic team at OOOC Ter Heide, an independent and nationally recognized child assessment center, conducted a comprehensive evaluation of Ethan over multiple sessions concluding on 17-09-2023. The assessment included clinical interviews with Ethan and his mother, behavioral observations, standardized psychological testing, and review of all available medical and institutional records.

**Findings:**
OOOC Ter Heide found that:
1. Ethan presents with complex post-traumatic stress disorder (cPTSD).
2. The trauma is causally linked to both the initial school incident (28-10-2021) and subsequent institutional handling.
3. Out-of-home placement would be contraindicated and likely harmful.
4. The threat of removal itself has caused documented psychological distress.

**Conclusion:**
The report explicitly states: "Out-of-home placement would be contraindicated and likely harmful to this child's psychological wellbeing. We strongly recommend against extension of such measures." (Exhibit A10, Final Report, Section 5.2).

**Legal Relevance:**
This expert assessment directly contradicts the basis for continued intervention and satisfies the requirement that decisions be based on the child's best interests supported by professional evidence.

**Diagnostic Findings:**
The cPTSD diagnosis encompasses:

3. Negative alterations in cognition and mood
4. Hyperarousal and reactivity
5. Additional complex features including emotional dysregulation and altered self-perception

**Causation:**
MPK/Vleugel K explicitly links the cPTSD to two causal factors:
1. Primary trauma: The school bullying and stabbing incident (28-10-2021)
2. Secondary trauma: Institutional responses, including juvenile court processes

**Treatment Recommendations:**
[INCLUDE ANY TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CONTRADICT PROPOSED INTERVENTIONS]

**Legal Relevance:**

## Tips for Using Expert Evidence

### Do:
- ✅ Cite specific page numbers and sections
- ✅ Use direct quotes when they're strong
- ✅ Explain technical terms in plain language
- ✅ Connect findings to legal standards (best interest, proportionality, necessity)
- ✅ Highlight where experts agree (builds consensus)
- ✅ Note the independence and qualifications of experts

### Don't:
- ❌ Overstate or mischaracterize expert findings
- ❌ Cherry-pick quotes out of context
- ❌ Ignore limitations or qualifications the expert noted
- ❌ Present expert opinion as absolute fact
- ❌ Forget to attach the actual expert report as an exhibit

### Strengthening Expert Citations

**Multiple experts agreeing:**
> Both OOOC Ter Heide (17-09-2023) and MPK/Vleugel K independently reached the same conclusion: out-of-home placement is contraindicated and would cause harm. This expert consensus should control over administrative preference.

**Expert vs. institutional claim:**
> While SDJ characterized the measure as "short-term diagnostics," OOOC Ter Heide—conducting the actual diagnostic work—found no justification for out-of-home placement whatsoever, stating it would be "harmful."

**Timing and causation:**
> The ER visit (11-11-2022) occurred just 43 days after the out-of-home placement order (29-09-2022), demonstrating immediate and acute distress directly attributable to the threat of removal.
