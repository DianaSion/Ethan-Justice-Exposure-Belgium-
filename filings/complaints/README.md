### Before Filing

2. **Gather exhibits** referenced in the complaint
3. **Verify all facts** against source documents in `/evidence/`

### Legal Counsel
**IMPORTANT:** These templates should be reviewed and customized by legal counsel familiar with Belgian juvenile law, civil procedure, and human rights standards before filing.

## Key Legal Issues Addressed

### 1. Procedural Timing Defect

- Due process violation
- Factual basis undermined by subsequent findings

### 2. Evidence Access
- Right to access case files
- Chain of custody for seized audio
- Explanation for discounting evidence
- Missing school protocol pages

### 3. Expert Consensus Disregarded
- OOOC Ter Heide opposes placement
- MPK/Vleugel K documents cPTSD
- ER records show acute distress
- Proportionality and necessity questions

### 4. Purpose Drift
- "Short diagnostics" vs. long-term institutionalization plan (A-DOC)
- Subsidy requests inconsistent with child-centered care
- Hidden institutional planning

### 5. Manufactured Non-cooperation
- CLB refused reasonable accommodation (1-on-1 meeting)
- Medical justifications disregarded
- Escalation on false grounds
