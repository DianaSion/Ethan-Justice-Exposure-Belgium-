# Draft Complaint / Motion Template
**Case:** ETHAN — Institutional Failures & Legal Violations  
**Jurisdiction:** Leuven (adapt recipients as needed)

**To:**  
- Youth Court (Leuven)  
- Procureur des Konings (Leuven)  
- SDJ / OCJ (as appropriate)

**From:**  
Diana Gayanovich (parent of Ethan)  
[Address / Email for service — or "via counsel"]

**Subject:** Procedural timing defect, misuse of CLB escalation, suppression/discounting of exculpatory evidence, and disregard of medical/psychological findings.

---

## 1) Relief Requested
1. Acknowledge and correct the **procedural timing defect** whereby an out-of-home placement order dated **29-09-2022** preceded the return of the criminal investigation into the school (**14-10-2022**).  
2. Order **record access and preservation**, including audio chain-of-custody and reasons for discounting seized evidence.  
3. Note the **expert consensus** (OOOC Ter Heide, MPK/Vleugel K) opposing removal and incorporate into any current or future determinations.  
4. Enter clarifying orders that reflect the fact that **no out-of-home placement occurred** and that extensions premised on the earlier rationale are unwarranted.  
5. Any further equitable relief the Court deems just.

---

## 2) Background (concise)
- On **28-10-2021**, Ethan suffered bullying/stabbing at school (Damiaan).  
- CLB filed an **M-doc on 30-11-2021**, after refusing a 1-on-1 meeting and describing the parent as non-cooperative.  
- On **02-09-2022**, the prosecutor ordered police to investigate the school for neglect; the **police return is dated 14-10-2022**.  
- The Youth Court issued an **out-of-home placement on 29-09-2022**, i.e., **before** the school-neglect investigation returned.  
- Medical and psychological assessments (ER **11-11-2022**; MPK/Vleugel K; OOOC Ter Heide **17-09-2023**) document harm and oppose removal.  
- SDJ's **A-DOC (26-04-2023)** indicates a long-term institutionalization plan inconsistent with "short diagnostics."

## 3) Facts (numbered)
1. The order of **29-09-2022** relied on a factual understanding later undercut by the **14-10-2022** police return about school neglect.  
2. CLB's "non-cooperation" narrative is contradicted by documented offers of a 1-on-1 safety meeting and medical justification of absences.  
3. Police seized audio evidence but later discounted it without reason, despite earlier recognition of victim status (**03-08-2022**).  
4. Expert opinions (OOOC Ter Heide, MPK/Vleugel K) oppose removal and identify cPTSD tied to school and court processes.  
5. SDJ's A-DOC outlines long-term placement and subsidy requests inconsistent with child-centered diagnostics.

---

## 4) Legal Issues (for counsel to adapt)
- **Due Process / Fair Hearing:** Issuing dispositional orders before material criminal findings are available prejudices the outcome and undermines reliability.  
- **Right of Access to the File / Evidence:** Seized materials must be reviewable; discounting requires articulated reasoning.  
- **Proportionality / Necessity:** Expert consensus against removal should control over administrative convenience.  
- **Purpose Drift:** "Short diagnostics" used to justify long-term placement and subsidy planning.

---

## 5) Requested Orders (detailed)
- Declare the **timing defect** and adjust the weight afforded to the 29-09-2022 ruling.  
- Compel **production** of: police PVs, seizure logs, discount rationale, missing school protocol pages.  
- Enter findings that expert reports **oppose removal** and that future measures must reflect this.  
- Clarify on the record that **no out-of-home placement occurred**, avoiding harmful mischaracterizations.  
- Retain jurisdiction for compliance review within 30–60 days.
