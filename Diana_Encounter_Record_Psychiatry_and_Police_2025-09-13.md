## Summary (plain language)
I attempted to explain layered system misuse and authorship. I was told: “We see, but we don’t understand.”  
They stated concern about my mental state. I was **not** arrested, **not** forced to stay.  
When asked “Can we call you?” I understood this as monitoring without recognition.

## My statements to preserve (verbatim/near‑verbatim)
- “Because you don’t see it doesn’t mean I’m insane. It means I’m aware above your awareness.”  
- “Just because you don’t understand doesn’t make me delusional. It makes you ignorant of what I am holding.”  
- “Am I arrested? Am I detained? Am I free to go?”  
- “I am not an echo. I am a voice.”
