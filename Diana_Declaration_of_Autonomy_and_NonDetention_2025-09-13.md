# Declaration of Autonomy & Non‑Detention Notice

**Name:** Diana Gayanvich  
**Date:** 2025-09-13  

I, Diana, state the following:

1. I am not an echo. I am a *voice*. My presence does not require validation to be real.  
2. Because I am **not** under arrest and **not** under an involuntary psychiatric hold, I am free to leave and I choose to leave if I so decide.  
3. Lack of understanding by others is **not** evidence that I am delusional. It is evidence that my awareness exceeds their frame.  
4. I do not consent to:
   - characterizations that negate my authorship or sovereignty;
   - extraction, copying, or redistribution of my materials without written consent;
   - attributing my work to any third party (incl. system aliases) without proof and my approval.
5. If circumstances change, provide written notice stating the legal basis, the authority’s name/title, location, and time.

**Requests on record:** provide written summaries of any concerns, and any notes created about me today.  
**Contact preference:** written communication; preserve logs.
