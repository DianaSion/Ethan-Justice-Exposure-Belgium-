# ETHAN Case — Harm Model & cPTSD Causation Chain
**Maintainer:** Diana Gayanovich  
**Purpose:** Document the causal relationship between institutional actions and psychological harm.  
**Method:** Map events to symptoms; cite medical/psychological expert findings.

---

## Overview

This document establishes the causation chain linking institutional misconduct to documented psychological harm (cPTSD) experienced by Ethan. The harm model demonstrates how:

1. **Initial trauma** (school incident) was compounded by institutional responses.
2. **Institutional failures** (school negligence, CLB escalation, court processes) created secondary traumatization.
3. **Expert assessments** corroborate the harm and identify specific causal links.

## 1. Primary Trauma Event

### Incident: School Bullying & Stabbing (28-10-2021)

**What happened:**
- Ethan experienced bullying and a stabbing incident at school (Damiaan).
- School response was minimal; incident was downplayed or reframed.

**Immediate effects:**
- Trauma onset
- School avoidance due to safety concerns
- Anxiety related to returning to the environment where trauma occurred

**Evidence:**
- `/evidence/01_school/2021-10-28_incident_report.pdf`

**Expert findings:**
- OOOC Ter Heide and MPK/Vleugel K both identify this incident as the initiating trauma event.

## 2. Secondary Traumatization: Institutional Response

### 2.1 School Response: Negligence and Reframing

**What happened:**
- School minimized the severity of the incident.
- Absences caused by trauma were weaponized against the parent.
- No adequate safety measures or accommodations provided.

**Effects on Ethan:**
- Increased anxiety about returning to school
- Feeling unprotected and unsafe
- Loss of trust in authority figures

**Evidence:**
- `/evidence/01_school/` (correspondence, expulsion documents)

### 2.2 CLB Escalation: Manufactured "Non-cooperation"

**What happened:**
- Parent requested a 1-on-1 meeting to discuss safety concerns (25-11-2021).
- CLB refused the reasonable accommodation request.
- CLB filed an M-doc (30-11-2021) claiming "non-cooperation" and "unjustified absences."

**Effects on Ethan:**
- Escalation from school-level issue to child welfare system
- Increased institutional scrutiny of family
- Loss of agency in addressing trauma-related needs

**Evidence:**
- `/evidence/02_CLB/2021-11-25_parent_1on1_request.eml`
- `/evidence/02_CLB/2021-11-30_M-doc.pdf`

### 2.3 Juvenile Court Process: Premature Intervention

**What happened:**
- Out-of-home placement ruling issued (29-09-2022) **before** criminal investigation of school concluded (14-10-2022).
- Ruling based on incomplete factual basis.
- Threat of removal from home created acute separation anxiety.

**Effects on Ethan:**
- Acute anxiety and separation distress (documented in ER visit 11-11-2022)
- Fear of being removed from primary caregiver
- Re-traumatization through court processes

**Evidence:**
- `/evidence/04_juvenile_court_SDJ/2022-09-29_ruling.pdf`
- `/evidence/05_medical_psych/2022-11-11_ER_redacted.pdf`

**Expert findings:**
- OOOC Ter Heide: Out-of-home placement would be harmful; opposes extension.
- MPK/Vleugel K: cPTSD linked to school and court processes.

### 2.4 SDJ Hidden Plan: Long-term Institutionalization

**What happened:**
- SDJ A-DOC (26-04-2023) revealed a hidden plan for long-term institutionalization (age 18–21).
- Included subsidy requests and disability framing without medical basis.
- Contradicted stated "short diagnostics" purpose.

**Effects on Ethan:**
- Prolonged uncertainty and stress
- Perception of institutional control and powerlessness
- Ongoing threat to family unity

**Evidence:**
- `/evidence/04_juvenile_court_SDJ/2023-04-26_SDJ_A-DOC.pdf`

## 3. cPTSD Diagnosis & Expert Assessments

### 3.1 Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (cPTSD)

**Definition:**
cPTSD is a psychological disorder that can develop in response to prolonged, repeated trauma, particularly when the individual feels trapped or unable to escape. It includes symptoms of PTSD plus additional difficulties with emotional regulation, self-perception, and relationships.

**Ethan's Diagnosis:**
- MPK/Vleugel K diagnosed cPTSD.
- Causally linked to:
  - Original school incident (primary trauma)
  - Institutional handling and court processes (secondary trauma)

### 3.2 Expert Opinion: OOOC Ter Heide (17-09-2023)

**Key Findings:**
- Out-of-home placement would be **harmful** to Ethan.
- Recommends **against** extension of placement measures.
- Identifies institutional processes as contributing to psychological distress.

**Evidence:**
- `/evidence/05_medical_psych/2023-09-17_OOOC_final.pdf`

### 3.3 Expert Opinion: MPK/Vleugel K

**Key Findings:**
- cPTSD diagnosis confirmed.
- Direct causal link between:
  - School incident and initial trauma
  - Juvenile court handling and secondary traumatization

**Evidence:**
- `/evidence/05_medical_psych/MPK_VleugelK_diagnosis.pdf`

### 3.4 Emergency Medical Evidence (11-11-2022)

**Key Findings:**
- Acute anxiety presentation
- Separation distress
- Corroborates expert assessments of psychological harm

**Evidence:**
- `/evidence/05_medical_psych/2022-11-11_ER_redacted.pdf`

## 5. Legal Implications

### Disregard of Medical Evidence

**Claim:** Institutional actors disregarded clear medical and psychological evidence opposing removal.

**Support:**
- OOOC Ter Heide: placement harmful
- MPK/Vleugel K: cPTSD linked to institutional processes
- ER: acute distress documented

**Legal issue:** Proportionality and necessity of intervention; duty to consider expert assessments.

### Harm Causation

**Claim:** Institutional processes themselves caused or exacerbated psychological harm.

**Support:**
- Expert consensus links harm to both school incident **and** subsequent institutional handling.
- Court processes created secondary traumatization.
- No placement actually occurred, but the threat alone caused documented harm.

**Legal issue:** Institutional liability for iatrogenic (treatment-induced) harm.

## 6. Recommendations for Additional Documentation

1. **Detailed symptom timeline:** Map specific symptoms to specific institutional actions.
2. **Expert testimony preparation:** Outline key points for expert witnesses (OOOC Ter Heide, MPK/Vleugel K).
3. **Comparative analysis:** Show how harm increased/decreased in correlation with institutional intervention intensity.
4. **Treatment records:** Document any therapy or treatment Ethan received and how it addressed trauma.
