# ETHAN Case — Contradictions Log
**Maintainer:** Diana Gayanovich  
**Purpose:** Track where institutional claims conflict with documentary evidence.  
**Method:** Pair each assertion with the record that disproves it. Link to exhibits in `/evidence` and keep dates precise.

---

## How to use this file
- Add a new row for each contradiction you identify.
- Keep exhibit names identical to files in `/evidence`.
- If a fact is disputed, mark it **DISPUTED** and include both sides.
- Prefer primary source exhibits (orders, reports, emails, medical notes).

## Table of contradictions

| # | Institution/Actor | What they asserted | What the record shows | Key exhibits | Notes / next action |
|---|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Juvenile Court (Leuven) | Out-of-home placement justified on current facts | Placement order dated **29-09-2022** predates police report return on school neglect (**14-10-2022**) | `/evidence/04_juvenile_court_SDJ/2022-09-29_ruling.pdf`, `/evidence/03_police_prosecution/2022-10-14_police_return.pdf` | Due-process timing defect; cite in appeals/motion to reopen. |
| 2 | CLB | Parent "non-cooperative" and causing unjustified absences | Email offered **1-on-1** meeting for safety; medical justifications present; CLB refused and filed M-doc anyway (**30-11-2021**) | `/evidence/02_CLB/2021-11-25_parent_1on1_request.eml`, `/evidence/02_CLB/2021-11-30_M-doc.pdf` | Reframe as refusal of reasonable accommodation. |
| 3 | School (Damiaan) | No serious safety incident | Bullying + stabbing reported **28-10-2021**; internal handling minimized; later absences weaponized | `/evidence/01_school/2021-10-28_incident_report.pdf`, `/evidence/01_school/2021-11-xx_correspondence.pdf` | Attach witness notes if available. |
| 4 | Police/Prosecution | Audio "irrelevant"; complaint redirected toward mother | Seizure log shows audio taken; subsequent dismissal lacks reasoning; victim status recognized **03-08-2022** then sidelined | `/evidence/03_police_prosecution/2022-08-03_victim_ack.pdf`, `/evidence/03_police_prosecution/chain_of_custody_audio.pdf` | Ask for reasoning under access-to-file. |
| 5 | SDJ | "Short diagnostics" necessary | A-DOC (**26-04-2023**) shows long-term institutionalization plan (18–21) + subsidy track | `/evidence/04_juvenile_court_SDJ/2023-04-26_SDJ_A-DOC.pdf` | Central to purpose-shift argument. |
| 6 | Court narrative | Out-of-home placement implemented | Despite orders, **no actual removal** occurred; extensions contested; expert advice against removal | `/evidence/04_juvenile_court_SDJ/2023-09-17_OOOC_final.pdf` | Phrase outcome precisely to avoid mischaracterization. |
| 7 | Medical ignored | "No medical basis" for anxiety/separation distress | ER record **11-11-2022** + MPK/Vleugel K cPTSD findings | `/evidence/05_medical_psych/2022-11-11_ER_redacted.pdf`, `/evidence/05_medical_psych/MPK_VleugelK_diagnosis.pdf` | Map to harm/causation in `analysis/harm_model.md`. |
