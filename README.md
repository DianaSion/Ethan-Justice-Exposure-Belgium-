# ETHAN Case Repository — Institutional Failures & Legal Violations

Maintainer: Diana Gayanovich
Scope: Evidence, analysis, and filings related to the handling of Ethan’s case by the school (Damiaan), CLB, police, SDJ, and the juvenile court in Leuven.

> This repository documents a pattern of institutional misconduct: school negligence, CLB escalation on false pretenses, suppression of evidence by police/prosecution, pre-planned juvenile rulings made before criminal findings, and SDJ’s hidden plan to institutionalize Ethan for years. 

---

1) Executive Summary

School negligence and cover-up: A stabbing incident and repeated bullying were minimized or reframed; absences caused by trauma were weaponized against the parent instead of being addressed. 

CLB escalation on a false “non-cooperation” narrative: Diana proposed a 1-on-1 meeting due to safety concerns; CLB refused and recorded “non-cooperation,” then pushed an M-doc. 

Police & prosecution mishandling: The original complaint was turned against the mother; key audio evidence was seized then discounted; the prosecutorial track slid from criminal accountability to child-welfare scrutiny. 

Juvenile court timing defect: An out-of-home placement ruling (29-09-2022) arrived before the related criminal investigation of the school concluded (police report returned 14-10-2022). This procedural sequence is central to the due-process challenge. 

Expert opinions ignored: OOOC Ter Heide opposed removal and found such measures harmful; MPK/Vleugel K documented PTSD (cPTSD) linked to school and court processes; ER records corroborate acute distress. 

SDJ A-DOC revelation: A hidden plan to institutionalize Ethan long-term (to 18–21) and seek subsidies, contradicting the stated “short diagnostics” purpose. 

Outcome note: Although orders for out-of-home placement were issued, Ethan ultimately was not placed out of home; decisions and extensions were fought back via appeals and evidence.

2) Timeline (key anchors)

28-10-2021 — Stabbing/bullying at school; trauma begins. 

30-11-2021 — CLB files M-doc citing “non-cooperation” and “unjustified absences” despite medical justification and a request for a 1-on-1 meeting. 

03-08-2022 — Prosecutor recognizes Diana as victim; criminal track active. 

18-08-2022 — SDJ social investigation opens, shifting focus from the school. 

02-09-2022 — Prosecutor orders police to investigate Damiaan School (guilty neglect). 

29-09-2022 — Juvenile ruling for out-of-home placement issued before the school-neglect investigation is returned. 

14-10-2022 — Police complete the school-neglect investigation; juvenile ruling already stands. 

11-11-2022 — ER visit demonstrates acute anxiety/separation distress. 

26-04-2023 — SDJ A-DOC: hidden long-term institutionalization plan and funding requests. 

17-09-2023 — OOOC Ter Heide final diagnostic: out-of-home placement harmful; oppose extension. 

> Appeals and later expert reports consistently contradicted removal/extensive supervision and documented cPTSD linked to school and juvenile-court handling.

SDJ hidden plan & funding	A-DOC	Long-term placement pre-planned.

5) Legal Issues (argument scaffolding)

Procedural timing defect
Juvenile court issued a placement order while a closely related criminal investigation into school neglect was still underway; this sequencing undermines the factual basis claimed in the juvenile ruling and can be framed as a due-process violation. 

Suppression/discounting of exculpatory evidence
Seizure then dismissal of audio; victim status recognized then criminal case dropped; inability to access crucial files. 

Manufactured “non-cooperation”
CLB’s refusal of a reasonable one-on-one meeting; narrative then used to escalate to OCJ/SDJ. 

Disregard of medical/psych assessments
OOOC Ter Heide, MPK/Vleugel K, ER records contradict removal and document harm causation. 

Hidden long-term institutionalization plan / funding
A-DOC shows pre-planning and subsidies inconsistent with “short-term diagnostics.”

7) Privacy & Redaction

Redact names of minors, non-public staff, addresses, and identifiers.

Store unredacted originals offline; publish only necessary excerpts.

Keep an audit trail of redactions (what/why). 

---

8) Next Actions (checklist)

[ ] Populate /evidence/INDEX.md with each document’s date, source, and a one-line probative value. 

[ ] Build a case timeline in /analysis/timeline.md with exact citations. 

[ ] Draft complaints (SDJ conduct; denial of access; procedural defects) under /filings/complaints/. 

[ ] Prepare a motion/letter for record access and evidence preservation. 

[ ] Add expert excerpts (OOOC Ter Heide, MPK/Vleugel K) to /analysis/harm_model.md.

9) Maintainer Notes

Ethan was never actually placed out of home, despite multiple first-instance orders; appeals and expert input reversed momentum. Phrase outcomes precisely to avoid mischaracterization. 

Keep all statements tied to an exhibit; if a fact is disputed, mark it and cite both the claim and the counter-evidence.
